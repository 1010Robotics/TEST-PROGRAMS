# TEST-PROGRAMS

This repository contains programs written in RobotC to test various robot components (motors & sensors).

Each program is documented as to its functionality. The RobotC Datalogger should be used for recording the data and saving to a **.csv* file.

The **.csv* file is then read into a corresponding LabVIEW program for analysis.
